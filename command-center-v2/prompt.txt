Rebuild Mission Control 2.0 at /root/.openclaw/workspace/command-center-v2 with these features:

1. Firebase sync - Use config from /root/.openclaw/workspace/.keys/firebase.json - connect Firebase Realtime Database for data persistence

2. Google Workspace integration:
   - Gmail integration (show unread count, recent emails)
   - Google Calendar (show today's events)  
   - Google Drive (show recent files)
   Use OAuth2 flow with proper scopes

3. Agent Status panel:
   - Show agent swarm status (Scout, Builder, Artist, etc.)
   - Live status indicators
   - Task counts per agent

4. Skills panel with these skills:
   - Template Creator (create reusable templates)
   - Nano Banana (mini AI tasks)
   - Video Transcription (transcribe video files)
   Each skill should have a UI card with action button

5. Trello-style Kanban:
   - Drag and drop cards between columns (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done)
   - Add/remove cards
   - Persist to Firebase

6. Working file upload:
   - Upload files to Firebase Storage
   - Display uploaded files
   - Delete files

Keep the existing dark theme UI with the same navigation. Use React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion. Ensure proper Firebase initialization and all features work together seamlessly. Make it production-ready for Vercel deployment.
