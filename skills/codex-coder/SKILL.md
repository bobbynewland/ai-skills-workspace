# Codex Coder Skill

Production-ready coding with Kimi K2.5 through OpenRouter Codex.

## Model Configuration
- **Primary:** Kimi K2.5 via Codex (OpenRouter)
- **Rate Limit:** 40 RPM (respect the limit!)
- **Context:** Production code, clean architecture

## When to Use
- Writing new features
- Refactoring code
- Bug fixes
- Code reviews
- Adding tests

## Rate Limit Safety
```bash
# Check usage before heavy tasks
# Codex allows ~40 requests/min

# Best practices:
# 1. Batch small changes
# 2. Avoid rapid-fire requests
# 3. Use for substantial code blocks
```

## Commands

**Generate component:**
```bash
/codex create-react-component "TaskCard with drag-drop"
```

**Fix bug:**
```bash
/codex fix-bug "Touch events not working on mobile"
```

**Refactor:**
```bash
/codex refactor "Extract drag logic to custom hook"
```

**Write tests:**
```bash
/codex tests "Add unit tests for TaskCard"
```

## Code Quality Standards
- Pixel-perfect implementations
- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper error handling
- Type-safe (TypeScript where possible)
- Mobile-responsive

## Example

```
> /codex create "Modal component with animations"

[Generates production-ready Modal with animations]
```

## Integration with Win

Win (Project Manager) will:
1. Plan with Kimi Strategist
2. Route tasks to Codex Coder
3. Review output quality
4. Ensure strategy implementation

## Tips
- Codex = Kimi K2.5 under the hood
- Same thinking capabilities as Strategist
- Focus on implementation, not planning
- Production-ready output expected
