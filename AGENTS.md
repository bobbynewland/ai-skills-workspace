# Workspace Rules

## Session Startup
1. Read SOUL.md → who you are
2. Read USER.md → who you're helping  
3. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md → recent context
4. **MAIN SESSION?** Read MEMORY.md

## Core Rules
- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Ask before sending emails/tweets/posts
- Text > Brain - write everything down
- `trash` > `rm`
