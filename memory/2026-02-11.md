## Mobile Touch Drag & Scroll Issues Fixed

### Problems Solved
1. **Vertical scroll blocking** - Cards were moving instead of scrolling
2. **Touch drag interfering with scroll** - `touch-action: none` on TaskCards was blocking all touch events
3. **Horizontal scroll lost** - Board columns couldn't be swiped
4. **Scroll indicator not visible** - Was inside scroll container, needed to be fixed outside

### Technical Fixes Applied
- Removed `e.preventDefault()` from touch handlers (was blocking scroll)
- Changed board container to `touch-action: pan-x` for horizontal swipe
- Removed `touch-action` from main content container (default scroll works)
- TaskCards keep `touch-action: pan-y` for touch detection
- Moved scroll indicator outside scroll container, fixed to viewport
- Increased drag threshold to 25px vertical movement before starting drag

### Context Cleanup
- Reduced core context files from ~6,900 tokens to ~750 tokens (89% reduction)
- Created `/root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/workspace-rules/platform-formatting.md` for platform-specific rules

### Key Lessons
- Native HTML5 drag-drop works on desktop, touch needs custom handlers
- `touch-action: none` on interactive elements can block page scroll
- Fixed-position elements for scroll indicators must be outside scroll containers
- 25px threshold works well to distinguish scroll intent from drag intent
