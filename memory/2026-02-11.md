# 2026-02-11 - Mission Control Rebuild

## Fresh Start with Native HTML5 Drag-and-Drop

After multiple failed attempts with @dnd-kit library (collision detection issues across columns), rebuilt Mission Control from scratch using native HTML5 drag-and-drop API.

### Key Changes
- Replaced @dnd-kit with native HTML5 `draggable` attribute
- Used `onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDragLeave`, `onDrop` events
- Much simpler, more reliable cross-column sorting
- Visual feedback: cards highlight when dragging over a column

### Technical Notes
- Native HTML5 drag/drop is more reliable for Kanban boards
- No complex collision detection algorithms needed
- `dataTransfer` API passes task ID cleanly between columns
- Vercel deployment working: https://ai-skills-workspace.vercel.app

### Previous Failed Approaches (to avoid)
- @dnd-kit with closestCenter collision - only detected items within same SortableContext
- @dnd-kit with rectIntersection - didn't properly detect column containers
- @dnd-kit with pointerWithin - still had SortableContext limitations

### Resolution
Native HTML5 drag-and-drop solves all cross-column issues reliably.
