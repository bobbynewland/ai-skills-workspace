## Mission Control Mobile Fixes
- Fixed mobile scrolling bug (changed deprecated `user-scalable=no` to `maximum-scale=1.0`)
- Fixed drag-and-drop on mobile:
  - Added `touch-action: pan-y` to body, `pan-x` to board for proper scrolling
  - Improved touch event handlers with visual feedback (scale, box-shadow, opacity)
  - Cards now stay visible while dragging (opacity 0.9) instead of fading
  - Added container highlighting during drag
  - Fixed z-index and positioning issues

## MiniMax Usage
- Usage remains extremely low: 0-1 prompts per 5-hour window
- Full 300 prompts available
- No alerts triggered
