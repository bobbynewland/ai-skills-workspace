# AI Skills Bootcamp - Master Strategy v1
**Status:** MVP Phase | **Target:** $1M ARR

## 1. The Vision
A community-first platform empowering small business owners and entrepreneurs to launch AI-powered businesses. We don't just sell a tool; we sell the **outcome** (e.g., "Launch a Kids Clothing Brand", "Start a Social Content Agency").

## 2. The Product Ecosystem
### A. The Portal (The Tool)
*   **Status:** MVP near completion.
*   **Key Feature:** "Magic" Prompt Engine. Users input basic ideas; the system automates the engineering to ensure high-quality output (Images/Video) every time.
*   **Goal:** Zero friction. Make "noobs" look like 10-year vets.

### B. The Bootcamps (The Education)
*   Instructor-led, practical training.
*   Specific "Biz-in-a-Box" tracks (Clothing Brand, Agency, etc.).
*   This is the retention hook.

## 3. The Growth Engine: "The Hustler Loop"
**Ambassador Program**
*   **Offer:** Earn $10/mo recurring for every Pro user referred.
*   **Strategy:** Position this not just as an affiliate program, but as an **income opportunity** for hustlers.
*   **Viral Effect:** Users become marketers. The community sells itself.

## 4. Revenue Streams
1.  **Pro Subscriptions:** Recurring SaaS revenue.
2.  **Ambassador Volume:** High-volume referral traffic.
3.  **Agency Upsells:** "Done-For-You" services for clients who want us to execute the AI work for them.

## 5. Operations & Roadmap
**Phase 1: MVP & Infrastructure (Current)**
*   Finalize Portal MVP.
*   Establish "Winslow" as the Orchestrator (Marketing/Dev/Ops).

**Phase 2: The Ambassador Launch**
