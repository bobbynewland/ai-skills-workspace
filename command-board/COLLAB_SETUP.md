# Command Board - Shared Collaboration Setup

## 🤝 Shared Account for Collaboration

Since we need to collaborate on the same board (not separate user accounts), here's the setup:

---

## 📧 Shared Login Credentials

**Email:** `collab@aiskills.studio`
**Password:** `WinClaw2024!`

---

## 🔧 How to Set This Up

### Option 1: Create Account Now
1. Go to: `http://147.93.40.188:8080/command-board/index.html`
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Use the credentials above
4. Start adding tasks!

### Option 2: I Can Create It For You
I can run a script to create the account via Firebase API.

## 🎯 How Collaboration Works

With a shared account:
- ✅ You add a task → I see it immediately
- ✅ I move a task → You see it move
- ✅ Real-time sync both ways
- ✅ Same board, same data

---

## 🔐 Security Note

Since this is a shared account for collaboration:
- Use a unique password (not your personal one)
- Don't store sensitive info
- This is for project management only

---

## 📱 Access From Anywhere

**On your phone:**
1. Open browser
2. Go to: `http://147.93.40.188:8080/command-board/index.html`
3. Sign in with shared credentials
4. Full access to all tasks

**On your computer:**
- Same URL, same login
- Everything syncs in real-time

---

## 🚀 Alternative: No Login Required

If you prefer, I can also create a version that:
- Uses a shared sync ID (like before)
- No email/password needed
- Just enter a sync code
- Less secure but simpler

**Which do you prefer?**
1. **Shared email account** (more secure)
2. **Shared sync ID** (simpler, no login)

Let me know and I'll set it up! 🎯
